Sierra Nevada Space Gun

High-Frequency Mass Launch for Non-Traditional Markets
Space Tech Conference Pitch | February 2026

<!-- Slide number: 2 -->
The Market Nobody's Serving

10M+ people annually become terminally mobility-impaired:

• Cancer patients immobilized in final months
• C4+ spinal injuries (17K new cases/year US)
• ALS, MS, Parkinson's progression
• Wheelchair-dependent elderly

These people have money. They have no place to spend it on mobility restoration.

The Physics Problem:

1G on Earth = bedsores, atrophy, immobility, pain
0.1G in rotating habitat = slam dunks from a wheelchair

The service is physically impossible to deliver on Earth.

Traditional Rockets
SNSG for Cargo
• $50M+ per launch
• Monthly launch windows
• 3-4G acceleration
• Still requires astronaut fitness

Totally unsuitable for
mobility-impaired clients
• $2-5M per launch
• Launch every 5-10 minutes
• 3-4G acceleration

Handles habitat modules,
supplies, equipment at scale

Patients: separate transport
(spaceplanes, <2G profile)

SNSG Technical Architecture

![preencoded.png](Image0.jpg)
System Overview (Cargo/Infrastructure):

1. 40km horizontal conveyor tunnel (deep-water port → Sierra Nevada cave)

2. 3-5 vertical maglev launch shafts in mountain cavity

3. Superconducting rails + water-cooled solenoids for 20-second acceleration

4. 150-ton fuel capacity (6m LOX, 8m LH₂ balloon tanks) → 5-ton payload

5. Exit velocity Mach 1.5-2.0 at 3-4G
Patient transport: separate gentler profile (spaceplanes, <2G sustained acceleration)
Launch cadence: 5-10 minutes  |  Cost per launch: $2-5M

### Notes:

Service Model

Patient Transport
$100-150K
Spaceplane or gentle-profile vehicle to orbit, <2G acceleration

Habitat Operations
$15-25K/month
0.1-0.3G rotating facility, medical monitoring, life support

Medical Staff
$8-12K/month
Zero-G trained palliative care specialists

Visitor Transport
$30K/person
Transport costs per person as needed

Food Production
Included
Grown in orbital greenhouses, aquatic protein raised on-site

Average 3-6 month stay: $550K-1.1M  |  One-way mission (no return transport)

### Notes:

<!-- Slide number: 7 -->
Orbital Reusability
Everything launched stays in orbit and gets reused. Nothing comes back.

Spent Engines
Smelted on-site
Alloy for structural components, replacement parts, fabrication

Balsa Wood Intertanks
Orbital carpentry
Furniture, interior partitions, habitat components

Wood Waste
Processing
Substrate for orbital greenhouses

Organic Material
Closed-loop system
Food production, aquatic protein farming
Extraction and processing have real costs, but cheaper than launching equivalent mass

5-Year Revenue Model

### Chart: Revenue ($M)

| Category | Revenue |
|---|---|
| Year 1 | 180.0 |
| Year 2 | 540.0 |
| Year 3 | 1350.0 |
| Year 4 | 2700.0 |
| Year 5 | 5100.0 |

Volume Assumptions:
Yr 1: 200 patients @ $900K avg
Yr 5: 5,000 patients @ $1.02M avg
EBITDA Margin: 65% by Year 3
Payback Period: 7-9 years

Competitive Moat

Infrastructure Barrier
$8-10B tunnel + launch system = 10-year head start

Regulatory Capture
First mover establishes medical zero-G protocols, FAA approval

Unit Economics
90% cost advantage vs rockets makes competition unviable

Network Effects
First operational habitat attracts medical staff, reputation, referrals

Technical & Market Risk

Key Risks
De-Risking Strategy
• Balloon tank survival through atmosphere
• Maglev thermal management at scale
• Medical certification for 3-4G launch
• Customer acceptance of service model
• 1:10 demonstrator validates physics
• Partner with NASA for medical protocols
• Survey target customer segments early
• Modular rollout (1 shaft → 5 shafts)

The Real Risk: Someone Else Builds It First
This market is worth $10-20B annually at maturity. First mover wins regulatory approval, builds medical expertise, and captures premium positioning. Waiting means competing against an established operator with infrastructure already amortized.
